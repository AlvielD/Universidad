CIRCUIT OVERTURNS NLRB DECISION ON WORKPLACE CONDUCT POLICIES A California firm's two workplace policies barring abusive and threatening language and restricting solicitation and distribution did not constitute unfair labor practices, the District of Columbia Circuit rules, overturning a National Labor Relations Board decision (\"\"Adtranz ABB Daimler-Benz Transp. N.A. Inc. v. NLRB, \"\"D.C. Cir., No. 00-1282, 6/26/01). The board held the workplace conduct policies of Adtranz ABB Daimler-Benz Transportation N.A. Inc. interfered with employees' exercise of their rights under the National Labor Relations Act. The board ordered that a second election be held to determine whether Adtranz employees in Pittsburg, Calif., wanted to be represented by the Machinists Automotive Trade District Lodge 190 of Northern California. The appeals court finds it lacks jurisdiction to consider Adtranz's appeal of the order for a new election, because it is not a final order. The court rejects the board's view that the ban on abusive and threatening language was an unfair labor practice regardless of whether it actually chilled employees' exercise of their rights. Judge Sentelle finds the solicitation-distribution rule is legal because it \"\"only applies to conduct during working time and in the work place\"\" and \"\"applies across the board, so it cannot be said to discriminate against unionization efforts or other protected activity.\"\" . . .

Northern States Power Co., \"\"7th Cir., No. 00-3746, 6/26/01). Loretta M. Emerson failed to show she was a \"\"qualified individual\"\" under the act, given that her anxiety attacks could interfere with her ability to answer customer phone calls about gas or electricity emergencies, Judge Bauer finds, affirming summary judgment to Northern States Power Co. Bauer also finds Emerson posed a direct threat to her employer, because her job \"\"required prompt, accurate handling of emergencies such as gas leaks and downed power lines that could pose significant danger to the public.\"\" . . .

If all goes as planned, the affiliation of the 100,000-member union will become effective July 1. However, it appears one more hurdle may need to be cleared before the affiliation, which has been in the works for more than a year, becomes a reality. The ANA House of Delegates is scheduled to vote June 30 on a bylaw change that would require any state nurses' association that engages in collective bargaining to be a member of UAN within four years. This was a condition of the AFL-CIO granting a charter. It is unclear whether the bylaw change will pass, and if it does not what happens to the affiliation agreement. . . . Page B-1 http://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/dlr.nsf/id/a0a4j5j7f6_ NEW YORK CITY PARTLY IMMUNE FROM BIAS LAW, COURT FINDS In a case of first impression, a federal trial court overturns a jury's $1 million sexual harassment punitive damages award against New York City because it did not explicitly waive sovereign immunity from punitive damages under the city's human rights ordinance (\"\"Katt v. New York City, \"\"S.D.N.Y., No. 95 Civ. 8283 (GEL), 6/19/01). Rejecting the defendants' other post-verdict motions, however, Judge Lynch of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York upholds the jury's award of $400,000 in compensatory damages. The court rejects the city's affirmative defense that plaintiff Alli Katt failed to take advantage of the New York Police Department's complaint process, finding that she was intimidated into not doing so because of explicit and implicit pressure. The court also rejects the city's late-raised challenge to the timeliness of the complaint. . . .

Hoffa and challenger Tom Leedham both are nominated for the union's top office. Also nominated are current IBT Secretary-Treasurer Tom Keegel and Leedham running-mate Tom Gilmartin, the head of IBT Local 559 in Connecticut. Delegate voting will occur late June 28 to determine if the candidates received the requisite 5 percent support for their names to be placed on the ballot for the fall election among the union's 1.4 million members. That Hoffa will receive 5 percent of the delegates' votes is a foregone conclusion given his overwhelming support among the more than 1,700 delegates. Voice votes on various resolutions and constitutional amendments appear to show that Leedham has the support of only a few hundred delegates in his second challenge to Hoffa for the union presidency. However, Leedham and members of his campaign appear confident he will get the votes necessary to be placed on the ballot. Other members of Leedham's slate earlier received more votes than necessary to be placed on the ballot. . . . Page C-1 http://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/dlr.nsf/id/a0a4j5g8z1_ OSHA READIES MANDATORY EMPLOYER SURVEY FOR DISTRIBUTION The week of July 2 will signal the launch of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's annual mandatory survey of more than 80,000 employers nationwide to gather injury and illness data to better target high-hazard employers. The agency, however, will not include construction employers in the upcoming survey. The 2001 survey program \"\"improves OSHA's ability to identify and target our efforts on the more hazardous workplaces,\"\" acting OSHA Administrator R. Davis Layne says. The survey requests calendar year 2000 data. OSHA inspections based on the 2000 data will not be launched until January or February of 2002, the OSHA spokesman says. Employers will be asked to supply figures for average employment, hours worked, and a summary of the job-related injuries and illnesses that occurred at their work sites in 2000, the agency says. The surveys must be returned even if a surveyed employer recorded no occupational injuries or illnesses for 2000, the agency says. . . .

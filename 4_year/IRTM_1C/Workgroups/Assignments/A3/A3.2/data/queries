<title> Anesthetics, Local
<desc> Description:
Drugs that block nerve conduction when applied locally to nerve tissue in appropriate concentrations. They act on any part of the nervous system and on every type of nerve fiber. In contact with a nerve trunk, these anesthetics can cause both sensory and motor paralysis in the innervated area. Their action is completely reversible. (From Gilman AG, et. al., Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 8th ed) Nearly all local anesthetics act by reducing the tendency of voltage-dependent sodium channels to activate. They are commonly used not only in the peripheral nervous system, but also for spinal anesthesia. The many drugs that have local anesthetic actions as a side effect but are not used for their local anesthetic action are not included here.

<top>
<num> Number: MSH266
<title> Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal
<desc> Description:
Anti-inflammatory agents that are not steroids. In addition to anti-inflammatory actions, they have analgesic, antipyretic, and platelet-inhibitory actions. They are used primarily in the treatment of chronic arthritic conditions and certain soft tissue disorders associated with pain and inflammation. They act by blocking the synthesis of prostaglandins by inhibiting cyclooxygenase, which converts arachidonic acid to cyclic endoperoxides, precursors of prostaglandins. Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis accounts for their analgesic, antipyretic, and platelet-inhibitory actions; other mechanisms may contribute to their anti-inflammatory effects. Certain NSAIDs also may inhibit lipoxygenase enzymes or phospholipase C or may modulate T-cell function. (AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1994, p 1814-5)

<title> Histocompatibility Antigens Class II
<desc> Description:
Large, transmembrane, non-covalently linked glycoproteins (alpha and beta). Both chains can be polymorphic although there is more structural variation in the beta chains. The class II antigens in humans are called HLA-D ANTIGENS and are coded by a gene on chromosome 6. In mice, two genes named IA and IE on chromosome 17 code for the H-2 antigens. The antigens are found on B-lymphocytes, macrophages, epidermal cells, and sperm and are thought to mediate the competence of and cellular cooperation in the immune response. The term IA antigens used to refer only to the proteins encoded by the IA genes in the mouse, but is now used as a generic term for any class II histocompatibility antigen.

<title> Collagen Diseases
<desc> Description:
Historically, a heterogeneous group of acute and chronic diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, progressive systemic sclerosis, dermatomyositis, etc. This classification was based on the notion that "collagen" was equivalent to "connective tissue", but with the present recognition of the different types of collagen and the aggregates derived from them as distinct entities, the term "collagen diseases" now pertains exclusively to those inherited conditions in which the primary defect is at the gene level and affects collagen biosynthesis, post-translational modification, or extracellular processing directly.

A condition characterized by abnormal posturing of the limbs that is associated with injury to the brainstem. This may occur as a clinical manifestation or induced experimentally in animals. The extensor reflexes are exaggerated leading to rigid extension of the limbs accompanied by hyperreflexia and opisthotonus. This condition is usually caused by lesions which occur in the region of the brainstem that lies between the red nuclei and the vestibular nuclei. In contrast, decorticate rigidity is characterized by flexion of the elbows and wrists with extension of the legs and feet. The causative lesion for this condition is located above the red nuclei and usually consists of diffuse cerebral damage. (From Adams et al., Principles of Neurology, 6th ed, p358)

They have lived on earth for about 350 million years, as compared with less than 2 million for man. While insects are often commercially valuable and useful as scavengers, many species are harmful, causing enormous losses in agriculture and storage. Three orders, HEMIPTERA, DIPTERA, and Siphonaptera, are of medical interest in that they cause disease in man and animal. (From Dorland, 27th ed; Borror et al., An Introduction to the Study of Insects, 4th ed, p1)

<title> Lipoproteins, HDL
<desc> Description:
A class of lipoproteins frequently divided into HDL2 and HDL3 and the minor variant HDL1. HDL promote transport of cholesterol from extrahepatic tissue to the liver for excretion in the bile. Synthesized by the liver as discoid "nascent HDL" particles lacking a lipid core, they accumulate a core of cholesterol esters during reverse cholesterol transport and transfer them to the liver directly or indirectly via other lipoproteins. HDL also shuttle apolipoproteins C-II and E to and from triglyceride-rich lipoproteins during catabolism of the lipoproteins. Serum HDL cholesterol has been negatively correlated with premature coronary heart disease. (Dorland, 28th ed)

<title> Lipoproteins, LDL
<desc> Description:
A class of lipoproteins responsible for transport of cholesterol to extrahepatic tissues. They are formed in the circulation when very-low-density lipoproteins are degraded first to intermediate-density lipoproteins and then to LDL by the gain and loss of specific apolipoproteins and the loss of most of their triglycerides. LDL are taken up and catabolized by both the liver and extrahepatic tissues by specific receptor-mediated endocytosis. (Dorland, 28th ed)

<title> Lipoproteins, VLDL
<desc> Description:
A class of lipoproteins that transport triglycerides from the intestine and liver to adipose and muscle tissues. Synthesized by the liver, they contain primarily triglycerides in their lipid cores, with some cholesterol esters. As their triglycerides are cleaved by endothelial lipoprotein lipase and transferred to hepatic tissues, the VLDL (very-low-density lipoprotein) particles lose most of their apolipoprotein C and become intermediate-density lipoproteins.

<title> Monoamine Oxidase
<desc> Description:
An enzyme that catalyzes the oxidative deamination of naturally occurring monoamines. It is a flavin-containing enzyme that is localized in mitochondrial membranes, whether in nerve terminals, the liver, or other organs. Monoamine oxidase is important in regulating the metabolic degradation of catecholamines and serotonin in neural or target tissues. Hepatic monoamine oxidase has a crucial defensive role in inactivating circulating monoamines or those, such as tyramine, that originate in the gut and are absorbed into the portal circulation.

<desc> Description:
The 2nd cranial nerve. The optic nerve conveys visual information from the retina to the brain. The nerve carries the axons of the retinal ganglion cells which sort at the optic chiasm and continue via the optic tracts to the brain. The largest projection is to the lateral geniculate nuclei; other important targets include the superior colliculi and the suprachiasmatic nuclei. Though known as the second cranial nerve, it is considered part of the central nervous system.

<title> Protein Deficiency
<desc> Description:
A nutritional condition produced by a deficiency of proteins in the diet, characterized by adaptive enzyme changes in the liver, increase in amino acid synthetases, and diminution of urea formation, thus conserving nitrogen and reducing its loss in the urine. Growth, immune response, repair, and production of enzymes and hormones are all impaired in severe protein deficiency. Protein deficiency may also arise in the face of adequate protein intake if the protein is of poor quality (i.e., the content of one or more amino acids is inadequate and thus becomes the limiting factor in protein utilization). (From Merck Manual, 16th ed; Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 12th ed, p406)

<title> Protein Kinase C
<desc> Description:
An enzyme that phosphorylates proteins on serine or threonine residues in the presence of physiological concentrations of calcium and membrane phospholipids. The additional presence of diacylglycerols markedly increases its sensitivity to both calcium and phospholipids. The sensitivity of the enzyme can also be increased by phorbol esters and it is believed that protein kinase C is the receptor protein of tumor-promoting phorbol esters. EC 2.7.1.-.

<title> Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid
<desc> Description:
Nucleotide sequences present in multiple copies in the genome. There are several types of repeated sequences. Interspersed (or dispersed) DNA repeats (INTERSPERSED REPETITIVE SEQUENCES) are copies of transposable elements interspersed throughout the genome. Flanking (or terminal) repeats (TERMINAL REPEAT SEQUENCES) are sequences that are repeated on both ends of a sequence, for example, the long terminal repeats (LTRs) on retroviruses. Direct terminal repeats are in the same direction and inverted terminal repeats are opposite to each other in direction. Tandem repeats (TANDEM REPEAT SEQUENCES) are repeated copies which lie adjacent to each other. These can also be direct or inverted. The ribosomal RNA and transfer RNA genes belong to the class of middle repetitive DNA. The highly repetitive class sequences have often been refered to as "junk DNA" because they are mostly non-coding sequence.
